            Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was an Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007.
           He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and
           studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and scienceadministrator, mainly at the Defence Research 
           and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space 
           Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts.[1] He thus 
           came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the 
           development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.He also played a pivotal organisational,
           technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear 
           test by India in 1974.
